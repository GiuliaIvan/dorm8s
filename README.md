Dorm8s WebApp was born as a school project for dorms.
Most of the dorms in Denmark have over 50 tenants that share a washing room. Dorm8s comes as a solution for this, as it provides the tenants a way to check the availability of the washing machines or dryers so as to prevent time wasting.
Additionally, some of the dorms have a shared kitchen for multiple tenants, therefore an agreement to have a kitchen tax from where they can buy commonly used products like dish soap, oil or onions for the kitchen. Dorm8s gives a hand to help the manager of the kitchen keep track of who paid or not and how much money there is in the common account.

The app is available only in mobile view and it can be downloaded as a Home Screen App
